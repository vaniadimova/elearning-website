                <p>Whether we're developing software or solving a business problem, we all have access to the information and materials 
                    necessary for doing our best work. And when these materials are accessible, we can build upon each other's 
                    ideas and discoveries. We can make more effective decisions and understand how decisions affect us.</p>

                    Good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas should win. 
                    Only by including diverse perspectives in our conversations can we 
                    be certain we've identified the best ideas, and decision-makers 
                    continually seek those perspectives. We may not operate by consensus,
                     but successful work determines which projects gather support and
                      effort from the community.

                    The open source way is a set of principles derived from open source software development models and
                     applied more broadly to additional industries and domains. Opensource.com exists to share how the open
                      source way can change our world in the same way the open source model has changed software.

                    Every time computer users view web pages, check email, chat with friends, stream music online, or play multiplayer video games, their computers, mobile phones, or gaming consoles connect to a global network of computers using open source software to route and transmit their data to the "local" 
                    devices they have in front of them. The computers that do all this important work are typically located in faraway places that users
                     don't actually see or can't physically accessâ€”which is why some people call these computers "remote computers."

                <p>
                    More and more, people rely on remote computers when performing tasks they might otherwise perform on their local devices. For example, they may use online word processing, email management, and image editing software that they don't install and run on their personal computers. Instead, they simply access these programs on remote computers by using a Web browser or mobile phone application. When they do this, they're engaged in
                     "remote computing. "Because open source code is publicly accessible, students can easily study it as they learn to make better software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique, as they develop their skills. When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.

                <p>
                    Some people call remote computing "cloud computing," because it involves activities (like storing files, sharing photos, or watching videos) that
                     incorporate not only local devices but also a global network of remote computers that form an "atmosphere" around them. While some open source software may be free of charge, skill in programming and troubleshooting open source software can be quite valuable. Many employers specifically seek to hire programmers with experience working on open source software.
